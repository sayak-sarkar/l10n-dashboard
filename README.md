l10n-dashboard
==============

A dashboard for keeping track of l10n statistics for various projects in a single page being developed with ease of access for localizers in mind. As an added feature the Dashboard would be developed in a mobile friendly responsive layout.


High-Level Project Goals
========================

 1. The system should provide a consolidated view for l10n statistics across projects and provide easy access to individual projects.
 2. The system should be capable of data visualization for real time data gathered from multiple sources, to provide enhanced reporting capabilities.
 3. The dashboard should be a double ended one: i.e. have separate views for organizations/maintainers and individuals.
 4. It has to be modularized, so as to separate the view from the back-end stores.
 5. It needs to easily deploy-able to enable individual teams to directly plug it to their own repositories and use it.
 6. The system has to be easily extendable to allow for easy modifications, as well as be light, efficient and user friendly.


Development Status
==================

~~The project is currently in **Development Phase 1**, with only a basic list of localiztion project links.~~

~~The project is currently in **Development Phase 2**, with a list of localization project links and an option to customize the links as per the users choice of locale.~~

The project is currently in **Development Phase 3**, where the dashboard APIs are currently being implemented.


Development Plan
================

The Dashboard would be developed in phases as follows:-

Phase 1:
--------
Create a simple HTML page listing out various l10n initiatives across various Open Source projects, and providing links to their individual l10n dashboards.

Phase 2:
--------
Incorporate language selection buttons [Dropdown menu with a list of most common languages], which would allow localizers to select the language of their choice. Upon selection of a prefered locale, the individual project links would be replaced by links to locale specific dashboard for the projects. For non-existing locales links to remain unchanged.

*Technical Details:*

**Note:** All Language codes are underscore separated.

**KDE Localization**
For the KDE Localization System: Replace the default URL[http://l10n.kde.org/teams-list.php] with 'http://l10n.kde.org/team-infos.php?teamcode=<language_code>' [e.g.:http://l10n.kde.org/team-infos.php?teamcode=bn]

**Pootle:**
For Pootle Based Systems: Append 'language-code/' [e.g.: bn_IN/]to the existing project URL. 

Custom implementations of Pootle include Verbatim [https://localize.mozilla.org/] and Localize [http://localize.mozilla.org/] for Mozilla as well as Damned Lies [https://l10n.gnome.org] for GNOME and Document Foundation [https://translations.documentfoundation.org/] for LibreOffice.

**Locamotion**
For Locamotion: Replace the string "projects" with the selected language code within the URL. For example, for the bn_IN locale for Firefox, the URL would change from http://mozilla.locamotion.org/projects/firefox/ to http://mozilla.locamotion.org/bn_IN/firefox/

**Transifex:**
For Transifex Based Systems: Append 'language/<language_code>/' [e.g.: language/bn_IN/] to the existing project URL. For example, for the Mozilla Webmaker project at https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/webmaker/, the URL would change to https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/webmaker/language/bn_IN/.

Phase 3:
--------
Incorporate Dashboard APIs from the most common l10n dashboards such as Transifex and Pootle, to provide translation statistics on the L10n Dashboard itself, hence allowing the localizers to have a good idea of the progress in translations in a single glance.

Phase 4:
--------
Incorporate Visual improvements to provide interactive menus as well as colorful progress bars. Incorporate an app-manifest to allow the usage of the site as a Web-App.

Incorporate Project Groups to sort the list of projects based on variou factors such as type of localization it uses, number of translators, completion status, etc.

Phase 5:
--------
Incorporate Translation leaderboard to display a sorted list of top l10n contributors across locales as well as in locale specific order.


Directory Structure:
====================

index.html:
-----------
Dashboard landing Page.

languages.json:
---------------
JSON file consisting of the list of supported languages, in the format "language": "language_code".

scripts/selector.js:
--------------------
JavaScript file consisting of application logic to extract the list of languages from languages.json and populate the language selector drop down menu in the primary landing page.

scripts/transifex.js:
---------------------
JavaScript file consisting of application logic to extract data from Transifex using the Transifex APIs and populate the dashboard with the relevant data.

stylesheets/style.css:
----------------------
Base style sheet for the dashboard landing page.
